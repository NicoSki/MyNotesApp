                Both you and I know very well that being a developer carries a great responsibility even more if you are
                a backEnd Developer because if your code is not clear and organized, another developer will not
                understand what you did... That's why i decided to create a note app where you can organize your
                differents tasks
            </p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>This App was created for you Too!</strong> No need to be a developer maybe you are a disorganized person or you have a friend who lives in a cloud. For those cases, i bring you the app that will solve your problems</p>
